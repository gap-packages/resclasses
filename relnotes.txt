                    Version history of the ResClasses package
                    =========================================

Initial version: 1.0 (January 2004)

Changes between version 1.0 and version 1.1:

 - Improved output routines.

 - Added `Density'.

Changes between version 1.1 and version 2.0:

 - Added `AllResidueClassesModulo'.

 - Added support for unions of residue classes with fixed representatives.
   These domains behave different than `ordinary' unions of residue classes:

   1. They behave like sets of single residue classes with fixed
      representative rather than like sets of ring elements.

   2. The residue classes are not necessarily disjoint, thus the unions can
      be viewed as multisets of ring elements.
