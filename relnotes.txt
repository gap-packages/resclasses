                    Version history of the ResClasses package
                    =========================================

Initial version: 1.0 (January 2004)

Changes between version 1.0 and version 1.1:

 - Improved output routines.

 - Added `Density'.

Changes between version 1.1 and version 2.0:

 - Added `AllResidueClassesModulo'.

 - Added support for unions of residue classes with fixed representatives.
   These domains behave different than `ordinary' unions of residue classes:

   1. They behave like sets of single residue classes with fixed
      representative rather than like sets of ring elements.

   2. The residue classes are not necessarily disjoint, thus the unions can
      be viewed as multisets of ring elements.

Changes between version 2.0 and version 2.0.2:

 - Fixed a bug in a `Union2' method for unions of residue classes
   (ExcludedElements were not treated correctly), which caused wrong results
   in some cases.

Changes between version 2.0.2 and version 2.0.5:

 - Cleaned up and compacted the manual.

 - Added `SplittedClass'.

 - Minor improvements in the manual and addition of a few trivial methods
   covering pathological cases.

Changes between version 2.0.5 and version 2.0.6:

 - Name changes: `DELTA' --> `Delta' and `RHO' --> `Rho'.

 - Fixed a bug in `RepresentativeStabilizingRefinement'.
   This bug could cause wrong results. Test code:

   gap> U := ResidueClassUnionWithFixedReps([[-1,3],[1,3],[3,3]]);;
   gap> U = RepresentativeStabilizingRefinement(U,0);
   true

Changes between version 2.0.6 and version 2.1.0 (August 8, 2005):

 - Significant performance improvements in `Union', `Intersection',
   `Difference' and `AsUnionOfFewClasses' for `sparse' unions of
   residue classes.

Changes between version 2.0.6 and version 2.1.1:

 - Adapted to an incompatible change in GAP 4.4.6 w.r.t. `InstallValue'
   for families.
