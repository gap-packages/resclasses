                                  Abstract

ResClasses is  a GAP 4 package for  set-theoretic computations  with  residue
classes of the integers and a couple of other rings.  The class of sets which
ResClasses can deal with  includes the open and the closed sets in the  topo-
logy on the respective ring which is induced by taking the set of all residue
classes as a basis,  as far as the usual restrictions  imposed by the finite-
ness of computing resources permit this.
    For details on how to use the  ResClasses package,  see the package docu-
mentation  in  the  `doc'  subdirectory  --  either  view  its  HTML  version
(chap0.html)  with  a browser,  or its  PDF version  (manual.pdf)  with a PDF
viewer.


                                Requirements

This version of ResClasses needs at least Version 4.4.12  of GAP and  Version
2.6 of Polycyclic, is completely written in the GAP language and does neither
contain nor require  external binaries.  GAPDoc Version 1.3 or higher is nee-
ded for displaying the online help.


                                Installation

Like any other  GAP package,  ResClasses must  be installed in the  pkg/ sub-
directory of the  GAP distribution.   This is accomplished  by extracting the
package archive file in this directory. By default, ResClasses is autoloaded.
This means that it is loaded automatically when you start GAP.
  For further advice  on questions of technical nature  please see the  chap-
ter `Installation and Auxiliary Functions' in the manual.


                          Distribution and Updates

New releases  of this package  are announced  together with releases of  RCWA
on the GAP Forum,  and the manual is put online on the package web page

    http://www.gap-system.org/DevelopersPages/StefanKohl/resclasses.html

If you are interested  in ResClasses,  then please  send me an e-mail,  and I
will send you the package archive file. I will also keep users informed about
bugfixes  and other issues  related to  the package.  Recent versions of this
package are not redistributed with GAP.
