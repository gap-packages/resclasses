                           The ResClasses Package
                           ======================


                                  Abstract

ResClasses is  a GAP 4 package for  set-theoretic computations  with  residue
classes of the integers and a couple of other rings.


                                Requirements

The  ResClasses Package  needs at least  version 4.4.7 of GAP,  is completely
written  in the  GAP language  and does neither contain  nor require external
binaries. A recent version of the package GAPDoc is needed.


                                Installation

Like any other  GAP package,  ResClasses must  be installed in the  pkg/ sub-
directory of the  GAP distribution.   This is accomplished  by extracting the
distribution file in this directory.   By default,  ResClasses is autoloaded.
This means that it is loaded automatically when you start GAP.

For further advice  on questions of technical nature  please see the  chapter
`Auxiliary functions' in the manual.

                                    ---
