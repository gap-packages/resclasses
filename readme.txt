                           The ResClasses Package
                           ======================


                                  Abstract

ResClasses is a GAP 4 package which implements  set-theoretic unions of resi-
due classes of the ring of integers, of its semilocalisations Z_(pi)  at some
finite set of primes pi  and of the polynomial rings GF(q)[x] as GAP domains.
It provides basic functionality for computing with these sets: forming inter-
sections,  unions,  differences etc.,  any of these also when one of the ope-
rands is  a finite set of ring elements.  It also implements the rings Z_(pi)
as GAP domains.


                                Requirements

The  ResClasses Package  needs at least  version 4.4.7 of GAP,  is completely
written  in the  GAP language  and does neither contain  nor require external
binaries. A recent version of the package GAPDoc is needed.


                                Installation

Like any other  GAP package,  ResClasses must  be installed in the  pkg/ sub-
directory of the  GAP distribution.   This is accomplished  by extracting the
distribution file in this directory.   By default,  ResClasses is autoloaded.
This means that it is loaded automatically when you start GAP.

For further advice  on questions of technical nature  please see the  chapter
`Auxiliary functions' in the manual.
