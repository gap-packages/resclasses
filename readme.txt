                           The ResClasses Package
                           ======================


                                  Abstract

ResClasses is  a GAP 4 package for  set-theoretic computations  with  residue
classes of the integers and a couple of other rings.  The class of sets which
ResClasses can deal with  includes the open and the closed sets in the  topo-
logy on the respective ring which is induced by taking the set of all residue
classes as a basis,  as far as the usual restrictions  imposed by the finite-
ness of computing resources permit this.


                                Requirements

The  ResClasses Package  needs at least version 4.4.10 of GAP and version 2.2
of Polycyclic,  is completely written  in the  GAP language  and does neither
contain nor require external binaries. GAPDoc version 1.1 or higher is needed
for displaying the online help.


                                Installation

Like any other  GAP package,  ResClasses must  be installed in the  pkg/ sub-
directory of the  GAP distribution.   This is accomplished  by extracting the
distribution file in this directory.   By default,  ResClasses is autoloaded.
This means that it is loaded automatically when you start GAP.

For further advice  on questions of technical nature  please see the  chapter
`Auxiliary functions' in the manual.
